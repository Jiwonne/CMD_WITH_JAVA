Writing a command line with Java!

I get this idea from my school project and google (I learnt others' code)

This is still in-progress.
I have a plan to make the program runnable with more command lines.

If you are interested in JavaFX, send an email to me.
We can discuss what to want, and we can collaborate together.
I'm good at making a story, but still need to learn JavaFX.
We can help out each other.

This program is managed by Jiwon Hwang.
Also, I am happy for any feedback :)
